description: How to use the React Native Reusables Registry Template
---

## Using the template

- The example components are found in the `packages/example-library` folder.
- The template includes the necessary config to use [react-native-reusables](https://reactnativereusables.com) components as dependencies.

<Callout>
  **Note:** The Reusables UI is installed in `packages/example-library/reusables`.
  
  If you want to use more `react-native-reusables` components as dependencies, you have to install them
  through the [CLI](https://reactnativereusables.com/docs/cli) inside `packages/example-library`.
</Callout>

## Building your own library

You can start by changing the `packages/example-library` folder name and replace all the references to it through the codebase.

<Callout>
  - All `package.json` files start with `@rnr/...` and you will need to update them with your own library name too.
  - All the imports throughout the codebase use aliases defined in `tsconfig.json` files. You can search by `@/example-library` and replace it with the new name of the folder.
</Callout>
